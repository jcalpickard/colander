# Colander: Opinionated experiments in browser tab arbitrage

Colander is an experimental Python script, initially for Firefox, that responds to information overload through intelligent browser tab triage and arbitrage. Combining research-through-design, field philosophy, and critical technical practice, this project explores practical interventions in digital information management, taking this as an opportunity to explore our relationship with the web browser.

## ðŸ”¬ Research approach & objectives

Colander approaches the browser as both a design space and a field site for investigative research. Through cycles of iterative prototyping and ethnographic inquiry, we aim to:

1. Explore transformative approaches to online information interaction
	- Investigate methods for enhancing contextual awareness in browsing
	- Develop tools to scaffold metacognition in digital spaces
	- Experiment with techniques to reduce users' cognitive load

2. Craft a methodological framework for curiosity-driven tech-ethnographic projects
	- Synthesise software development and programming practices with ethnographic inquiry
	- Propose models for integrating technical and social research in HCI

3. Prototype tools that embody theoretical concepts and arguments
	- Develop software tools as primary artifacts
	- Create complementary conceptual models, workflows, and physical interfaces
	- Explore the intersection of digital and tangible interaction paradigms`

This modest intervention serves as a vehicle for studying user behaviour, iterating on specific, situated responses to information overload, and translating research findings into practical tools and frameworks. Our approach is informed by the principles of permacomputing, anthropological perspectives on attention, cybernetic systems thinking, and the ethos of critical technical practice.
