# Colander: Opinionated experiments in browser tab arbitrage

Colander is an evolving ecosystem of experimental tools, starting with a Firefox extension and Python scripts, that responds to information overload through "intelligent" browser tab triage and arbitrage. This project combines research-through-design, field philosophy, and critical technical practice to investigate our relationship with digital information spaces, taking the web browser as a site of inquiry.


## Technical components

1. **Python scripts**: The core of Colander's backend processing, these scripts handle data analysis, tab categorisation, and integration with external tools.

2. **Firefox extension**: A lightweight frontend interface that supports real-time interaction with tabs, providing immediate feedback.

3. **duckyPad integration**: Exploring physical interfaces for digital information management.

These components serve as prototypes and proofs of concept, evolving and iterating as the project progresses.

## ðŸ”¬ Research approach & objectives

Colander approaches the browser as both a design space and a field site for investigative research. Through cycles of iterative prototyping and ethnographic inquiry, we aim to:

1. Explore transformative approaches to online information interaction
	- Use the Firefox extension as a platform for experimenting with real-time tab arbitrage techniques
	- Investigate the interplay of agency and automated processes in digital spaces
	- Investigate methods for enhancing contextual awareness in web browsing
	- Develop tools and techniques to scaffold metacognition and reduce cognitive load

2. Develop a methodological framework for curiosity-driven tech-ethnographic projects
	- Synthesise software development and programming practices with ethnographic inquiry
	- Propose models for integrating technical and social research in HCI

3. Practice philosophical carpentry
	- Develop tools as a form of argument and exploration
	- Use software development as a means of concretising abstract concepts
	- Create complementary conceptual models, workflows, and physical interfaces
	- Explore the intersection of digital and tangible interaction paradigms
	- Use critical technical practice to question emerging digital habits and norms

This modest intervention serves as a vehicle for studying user behaviour, iterating on specific, situated responses to information overload, and translating research findings into practical tools and frameworks. Our approach is informed by the principles of permacomputing, anthropological perspectives on attention, cybernetic systems thinking, and the ethos of critical technical practice.


## Current status and future directions

**Status:** Early-stage research and prototyping (as of July 2024)

While we are currently exploring and experimenting with browser-based information management, future directions for Colander include:

- Expanding the Firefox extension's capabilities
- Experimenting with novel human-computer interaction paradigms
- Integration with physical interfaces beyond the duckyPad
- Developing adaptive systems that co-evolve with user behaviour
- Applying tab arbitrage concepts to wider digital ecosystems

The project remains open to new directions suggested by research and prototyping.
